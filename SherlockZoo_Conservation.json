	"Premise": "Saving nature is a of critical importance to us here at Sherlock Zoo. Species extinction is far higher than nature intended, being at least 100-1000 times higher. There has been an astonishing 60% decline in the size of the population of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians in the last 40 years, with these impacts going far beyond losing cultural icons like tigers, rhinos and whales.",
	
	"Impact": "Conservation is very important for saving and preserving species. Look at the Giant Panda! They are often really popular in the zoos you can find them in, and you might have to go all the way to China to see them in the wild! There's only about 1,600 in the wild, and it's safe to say that they may have gone extinct long ago if people weren't preserving them. We can also help to raise the population of animals to be much higher, and help all kinds of species all around the world survive and thrive just like before. Protecting species also protects the ecosystem that brings us essential things like breathable air, clean water, food, fertile soil, and much more. By saving animals and their habitats, we are taking steps to save our gorgeous planet. Here at Sherlock Zoo, we are quite literally trying to save the world!",
	
	"Practice": "At Sherlock Zoo, we breed our animals in house. We do this because they can be raised safe and sound, without any risk of being hurt in the wild. We can help to take care of them too, as long as their parents are okay with it! We also have a reintroduction program, where we raise or rehabilitate animals in our zoo, and then set them free out in the wild. This gives the animal a good headstart in life and a better chance of surviving in the wild and helps to increase the wildlife animal population. We hate to leave them, but if you love something, let it go, it's for the best after all!",

	"Advocacy": "We work with people all over the world, helping to enable them to co-exist and thrive with their friends in the animal kingdom and help them to develop nature-friendly and sustainable livelihoods. We aim to help ease the human-animal conflict that can come from a human damaging an animal's habitat while collecting resources for their community. By implementing measures to improve the safety of the people and their livestock, and providing supplements to reduce the reliance on resources from the animal's habitat, we hope to reduce these conflicts.",
